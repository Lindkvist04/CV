My name is Filip and i am currently working as a property manager for a company called HSB. I have a degree in Computer science and Programming. 

 

I like to have alot of work at all times otherwise i can get a little bored. I always try to do a good, fast and clean job. I like to take responsibility and to help plan for projects. I work good in groups but sometimes i prefer to work alone because i feel like i can get stuff done faster then.

Education:

I have finished my courses and now have a degree. I also recived a reward at the end of our last school year for my knowledge within our computer related subjects and for being a good teamplayer that help others and work good in groups.

Few things we have learned: We have worked alot with servers due to us having a server lab in our classroom. In the lab we do cabling, installation of new servers and going through the logs/interfaces of the servers. We have been working with HMTL and CSS to build our own websites and we have also been working a bit with Unreal Engine. In the second year we also got to program a RC car. We have also talked and worked with Cyber security.
